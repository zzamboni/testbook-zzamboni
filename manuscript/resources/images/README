manuscript/resources/README file

This file was created by ox-leanpub to force Git to store this
directory. There are symlinks to this directory both from the
top-level and from within manuscript/, to make it easier for you
to include figures in your book by referencing them as
`images/figure.png', and have that path be accessible from (a) your
original Org file, (b) from the exported files in `manuscript/', and
(c) to have the files stored within `manuscript/resources' as
required by Leanpub's Markua processor.

If you remove this file/directory from your git repo, please also
remember to remove the symlinks, otherwise book generation will
fail (Leanpub sees the broken symlink inside manuscript/ as an
error).
